# Search Engine Query Tips (Updated: 21/02/2025)
- **Bing:** `search?q=giÃ¡&first=1&count=10`  
  - `q`: Search query string  
  - `first`: Starting item index  
  - `count`: Number of items per page (Currently, the max is ~50, but it's not stable. A value of 10 is more reliable.)  

- **Google:** `search?q=giÃ¡&start=0&num=100`  
  - `q`: Search query string  
  - `start`: Starting item index  
  - `num`: Number of items per page (No known max limit; works reliably with `num=100`.)
